When it comes to creating charts and graphs, there are a variety of tools available to us. One of the most popular choices for creating charts is through online chart makers. These tools offer a variety of options for creating different charts, including line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and box plots.

Box plots, also known as box and whisker plots, are useful charts for displaying statistical data. They can show the distribution, spread, and central tendency of a dataset. A box plot maker can help create these charts quickly and easily.

## What is a Box Plot?

A box plot is a chart that displays the distribution of a dataset. The plot includes a box, which represents the middle 50% of the data, a line inside the box that represents the median, and two whiskers that represent the minimum and maximum values. Outliers may also be shown as individual points outside of the whiskers.

Box plots can be useful for several reasons. They can help identify differences in distribution between different datasets, identify outliers, and show the overall spread of the data.
