## What is an Area Chart?

Before diving into the specifics of [area chart makers](https://docs.kanaries.net/charts/area-chart-maker), let's first understand what an area chart is. An area chart is a type of chart that displays quantitative data as a series of data points connected by a line and filled with color to create a two-dimensional area. The area between the line and the x-axis is filled with a color to represent the data range.

Area charts are commonly used to show changes in data over time. For example, a stock market area chart could show the stock price fluctuation over a certain period of time, while a weather area chart could display the temperature range for a specific location.
