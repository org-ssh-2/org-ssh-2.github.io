## What is a Histogram?

A histogram is a type of bar chart that represents the distribution of numerical data. It is used to display the frequency of occurrences of a variable in a set of data. A histogram is created by dividing the data into intervals called bins and then plotting the number of values that fall into each bin.

Histograms are commonly used to show patterns in large data sets and to identify outliers or anomalies. They are useful in many industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and education.
